WP Comsoon brings a *simple* way to display the titles of the next scheduled posts of your blog.

This Wordpress Widget allows you to display forthcoming articles of your blog.
You can configure this widget in the Wordpress Design Widgets SubPanel as follows:

* add your own title to the sidebar widget

* define how many posts are shown (1 to 30) in the widget (default: 5)
* select to show the scheduled date of the post (default: off)
* select to show the time of the posts (default: off)
* disable "No scheduled posts" message (default: shown)
* select the sortorder of the posts - if you have more scheduled posts than you want to show, a descending sortorder will only show the latest of your posts (default: ascending)
* disable "powered by WP Comsoon" message (default: message is shown)
* multi language support, german mofile included
